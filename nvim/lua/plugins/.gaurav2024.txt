me to gaurav:
Hmm...
A hardworking, passionate person who has a pragmatic approach to life. You don't daydream much about what you cannot achieve, but make the most of whatever is in your range. You don't lie (unlike me) though you don't share anything too, unless asked( which is kinda frustrating). You're someone who can put his ego aside to remove the slimmest possibility of offending someone and apologize even though it's not your or anyone's fault, like the message above. Yes the social anxiety is still there, but I can see it diminishing a small step after another. You're a helpful person too. Also once in a while you'll get into a "rant" stage with me which I absolutely love ðŸ˜‚. Introverted, but pure-hearted which makes you loveable and trustworthy.

gaurav to me:
Ok. So let's get started. 
You are a passionate, highly intellectual, funny(In your own ways) person. 
You might just be one of the most extroverted people I have ever seen. Like, you can start a conversation with literally anyone. Also, you were the one who started to interact with me in Library when, I didn't even knew that we were in the same classðŸ˜…. 
You are supportive, caring and understanding of others beliefs. 
But, tbh, there are certain things about you that cause me some icks like YOU CAN'T EVER SIT STRAIGHT ON CLASSROOM CHAIR.  Or YOU SWEAR SO LOUD IN PUBLIC or the way YOU BECOME SO IMPULSIVE WHEN YOU ARE EXCITED WHEN YOU WIN IN CHESSðŸ¤£
